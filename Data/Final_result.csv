My interior guys kept drawers for plate rack but unfortunately thalis don't fit in it. Other in cabinet racks has measurement or quality issues. This is the best way to incorporate a thali rack in your cabinet. The product is very thick/sturdy. I brought 2 for plates but planning to buy more for over trays/cutting boards etc etc. This product has nice gaps to hold thick items like thalis, oven trays, cup cake trays etc unlike other products which are useful only for thin plates . My only concern would be that after manufacturing they seemed to have gotten careless in handling the product since there are lot of scratches but nothing that effects it's looks or usefulness so not returning.
