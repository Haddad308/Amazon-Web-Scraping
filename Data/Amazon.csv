Reviewed in Egypt on 11 March 2022Verified Purchase
رجاء الانتباه إن الجهاز واجهتنى فيه مشكلة من أول ما اشتريته وهو انه بيهنج كل شوية الشاشة بتقف والماوس وبتضطر تعيد التشغيل من الباور. بالرغم من تجربة أكثر من ويندوز. مرة ويندوز 10 ومرة 11 وتم تحديث كل الدرايفرات والبايوس والمشكلة قائمة. واضح انها مشكلة فى الموديل نفسه.

Very good performance, but the battery is not the best
Reviewed in Egypt on 31 May 2022Verified Purchase
I bought this product 3 months ago and it's great, it performs greatly in gaming and you can download most of the new games, but only when connected to the charger because the battery is not that great, but it has a 1 year battery warranty

Just got this computer today, it is big and performs well, however the fans are loud. Also it is hard to get my headphones in and out of the audio jack. Hopefully some software updates fixes this.

getting hotsoldered ram (not upgradable)touch is good, but sometimes you need to use a mouse (I think it is from windows 11 and some apps which are not touch-friendly.)

Worth the money
Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 12 March 2022Verified Purchase
The good: Its a good build laptop. Can be used for normal Executive operations like word, excel, PPT. So basically 99% of the people in the world should be happy with this. It charges so fast that I was surprised that in like 1 hour it was full for a full day worth of battery.The bad: The worst part in this laptop is nothing to do with the laptop. Its windows 11. Its so bad. OMG. So many bugs. With respect to laptop the edges are quite sharp and it wi hurt the wrist if they tend to hang on its edges. There is no way to increase the RAM so basically you are stuck with it for the rest of its life. There is plenty of spare space inside this laptop. Lenovo could have given some spare slots for putting additional hardware. I am forced to carry a external hub to get additional slots like lan cable, micro sd etc. Like come on we live in 2022, manufacturers should have put all these port by default. They keyboard layout is designed for multi media and not Executive people like me. So i had t use a third party software to change the function of some of the keys. The weight is around 500 to 600 gms mire than its plastic body counter parts due to Aluminium body which i feel is too much.There are a few more issue. But over all I am very happy with this purchase. I am sure I will use this for years to come.

Reviewed in Egypt on 11 March 2022Verified Purchase
رجاء الانتباه إن الجهاز واجهتنى فيه مشكلة من أول ما اشتريته وهو انه بيهنج كل شوية الشاشة بتقف والماوس وبتضطر تعيد التشغيل من الباور. بالرغم من تجربة أكثر من ويندوز. مرة ويندوز 10 ومرة 11 وتم تحديث كل الدرايفرات والبايوس والمشكلة قائمة. واضح انها مشكلة فى الموديل نفسه.

Very good performance, but the battery is not the best
Reviewed in Egypt on 31 May 2022Verified Purchase
I bought this product 3 months ago and it's great, it performs greatly in gaming and you can download most of the new games, but only when connected to the charger because the battery is not that great, but it has a 1 year battery warranty

Just got this computer today, it is big and performs well, however the fans are loud. Also it is hard to get my headphones in and out of the audio jack. Hopefully some software updates fixes this.

getting hotsoldered ram (not upgradable)touch is good, but sometimes you need to use a mouse (I think it is from windows 11 and some apps which are not touch-friendly.)

Worth the money
Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 12 March 2022Verified Purchase
The good: Its a good build laptop. Can be used for normal Executive operations like word, excel, PPT. So basically 99% of the people in the world should be happy with this. It charges so fast that I was surprised that in like 1 hour it was full for a full day worth of battery.The bad: The worst part in this laptop is nothing to do with the laptop. Its windows 11. Its so bad. OMG. So many bugs. With respect to laptop the edges are quite sharp and it wi hurt the wrist if they tend to hang on its edges. There is no way to increase the RAM so basically you are stuck with it for the rest of its life. There is plenty of spare space inside this laptop. Lenovo could have given some spare slots for putting additional hardware. I am forced to carry a external hub to get additional slots like lan cable, micro sd etc. Like come on we live in 2022, manufacturers should have put all these port by default. They keyboard layout is designed for multi media and not Executive people like me. So i had t use a third party software to change the function of some of the keys. The weight is around 500 to 600 gms mire than its plastic body counter parts due to Aluminium body which i feel is too much.There are a few more issue. But over all I am very happy with this purchase. I am sure I will use this for years to come.

الجهاز بيهنج
Reviewed in Egypt on 11 March 2022Verified Purchase
رجاء الانتباه إن الجهاز واجهتنى فيه مشكلة من أول ما اشتريته وهو انه بيهنج كل شوية الشاشة بتقف والماوس وبتضطر تعيد التشغيل من الباور. بالرغم من تجربة أكثر من ويندوز. مرة ويندوز 10 ومرة 11 وتم تحديث كل الدرايفرات والبايوس والمشكلة قائمة. واضح انها مشكلة فى الموديل نفسه.

I bought this product 3 months ago and it's great, it performs greatly in gaming and you can download most of the new games, but only when connected to the charger because the battery is not that great, but it has a 1 year battery warranty

getting hotsoldered ram (not upgradable)touch is good, but sometimes you need to use a mouse (I think it is from windows 11 and some apps which are not touch-friendly.)

Worth the money
Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 12 March 2022Verified Purchase
The good: Its a good build laptop. Can be used for normal Executive operations like word, excel, PPT. So basically 99% of the people in the world should be happy with this. It charges so fast that I was surprised that in like 1 hour it was full for a full day worth of battery.The bad: The worst part in this laptop is nothing to do with the laptop. Its windows 11. Its so bad. OMG. So many bugs. With respect to laptop the edges are quite sharp and it wi hurt the wrist if they tend to hang on its edges. There is no way to increase the RAM so basically you are stuck with it for the rest of its life. There is plenty of spare space inside this laptop. Lenovo could have given some spare slots for putting additional hardware. I am forced to carry a external hub to get additional slots like lan cable, micro sd etc. Like come on we live in 2022, manufacturers should have put all these port by default. They keyboard layout is designed for multi media and not Executive people like me. So i had t use a third party software to change the function of some of the keys. The weight is around 500 to 600 gms mire than its plastic body counter parts due to Aluminium body which i feel is too much.There are a few more issue. But over all I am very happy with this purchase. I am sure I will use this for years to come.
